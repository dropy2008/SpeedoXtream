      <title>Peyton's 51-Game Passing Streak Snapped</title>
      <description>Peyton Manning's 51-game touchdown pass streak has officially ended. The four-year long streak was snapped on Sunday as the Broncos defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-17 in Denver. The superstar was 4 games away from breaking Drew Brees' record of 54 games with a touchdown pass. Sunday's game marks yet another game under 200 yards for Manning, but fans shouldn't get too upset. His numbers are down to the emergence of phenom running back C.J. Anderson.</description>
